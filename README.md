# LoZN64 | Legend of Zelda LevelUp!

This addon replaces the default level-up sound in World of Warcraft with the iconic **looting chest sound** from *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*.

> **Note:** You can still hear the sound even if all other game sounds are disabled — as long as the “Enable Sounds” option is turned on.
